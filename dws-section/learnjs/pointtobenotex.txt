1. We cannot call variable which is not defined.
2. NaN- Not a Number.

"abc" ______________ true
"" _________________ false
" "_________________ true
"a"_________________ true
"false" ____________ true
"true" _____________ true

INTERVIEW QUESTION 
What will be the output of following code?

"false"_________________ true // in string
0 ____________ false //in number
"0" _____________ true //in string


 () = paranthesis
 {} = block
 [] = array

import shotcuts = ctrl + space.


// truthy and falsy


SORT :-
       In javascript number sorting doesn't work properly, it provide result according to first word or number in the string. 
       [9, 10] => [10, 9]
       ["ae", "ac"] => ["ac", "ae"]
       ["aaz", "aaa"] => ["aaa", "aaz"]
       ["W", "a"] => ["W", "a"]
       ["a", "W", "A", "ram"] => ["A", "W", "a", "ram"]


OBJECT:- 
        Array is made from value. Object is made from key, value pair.
        Order does not matter in object.


REST OPERATOR:-
        Rest Operator does not declared in starting and middle. It must declared in end of the parameter.

Uses of or(||) for default value (not good for boolean)

   =>  || can be used to initilize the variable

   =>  During initilization first it looks for first value if the value is truthy value it returns the truthy value else it will search next truthy value

   =>  If all are falsy value it returns last falsy value

For nullis(??)
   =>  for || all are falsy value but ?? only null and undefined are falsy value
